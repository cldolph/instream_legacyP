# Overview

This repository includes input data, R scripts, and output files to reproduce analyses, figures and tables described in Dolph et al. (in review), entitled "Phosphorus transport in a hotter and drier climate: in-channel release of legacy phosphorus during summer low flow conditions". A preprint of the draft manuscript is available here: <https://egusphere.copernicus.org/preprints/2024/egusphere-2024-691/>

# Files:

"gaged_watersheds_data_processing_and_analysis_script.R" is the main data processing and analysis script file. It contains R script and related R modules for:

-   inputting, pre processing and analyzing concentration-discharge data for 143 gaged watersheds in Minnesota

-   comparing mean SRP among gaged watersheds to mean SRP among monitoried tile outlets from 10 farm fields

-   developing a random forest model for predicting mean SRP during late summer low flows for gaged watersheds, using 253 geospatial attributes derived predominantly from [EPA StreamCat](https://www.epa.gov/national-aquatic-resource-surveys/streamcat-dataset)

-   analysis of independent SRP concentration data collected in the field during late summer from ditches, streams and rivers in the heavily agricultural Le Sueur River Basin, Minnesota.
